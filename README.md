# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard - Monthly Report

# Problem Statement

Hospitals face significant challenges in managing emergency room operations, including long wait times, patient overload, inefficient resource allocation, and tracking patient satisfaction. A data-driven approach is needed to analyse key performance indicators and improve patient care. This dashboard provides a real-time view of emergency room statistics, enabling hospital administrators to make informed decisions, enhance operational efficiency, and optimize healthcare delivery.

# Data Overview

The data used for this dashboard has been procured from hospital records and contains the following columns:
* Patient ID: Unique identifier for each patient.
* Gender: Indicates whether the patient is male or female.
* Age: Patient’s age at the time of the visit.
* Patient Wait-time: The duration a patient waits before being attended to.
* Department Referral: The specialty department the patient was referred to.
* Admission Date: The date the patient was admitted.
* Satisfaction Score: The rating given by the patient on their ER experience.
* Patient Admission Flag: Whether the patient was admitted or not.
The dataset spans from April 2023 to December 2024, enabling an extensive analysis of emergency room trends over time.

# Overview

The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the emergency room (ER) statistics and performance metrics. This dashboard is intended for hospital administrators, medical professionals, and decision-makers to analyse patient trends, waiting times, admission status, and satisfaction scores.
Insights & Features

# 1. Key Performance Metrics
* Number of Patients: Displays the total number of patients that visited the emergency room in the selected month. In this case, the number is 9216.
* Average Patient Wait-time: Shows the average time a patient has to wait before receiving medical attention. The wait-time is 35.26 minutes.
* Patient Satisfaction Score: Indicates patient feedback on the emergency room services, rated on a scale. The current score is 4.99, suggesting high patient satisfaction.
  
# 2. Admission Status
* Admitted: The number of patients who were admitted to the hospital (4612, which is 50%).
* Not Admitted: The number of patients who were not admitted (4604, also 50%).
This metric helps assess hospital capacity and resource allocation.

# 3. Patient Attend Status
Categorizes whether patients were attended to on-time or experienced delays.
* On-time Attendance: 62% of patients were attended to without delay.
* Delayed Attendance: 38% of patients had to wait longer than expected.
  
# 4. Gender Status
Displays the gender distribution of emergency room patients.
* Female Patients: 51%
* Male Patients: 49%
This metric helps in analysing demographic patterns and ensuring equal healthcare services.

# 5. Age Group Analysis
Breaks down patient visits by age groups: 
o 0-9 years: 1176 patients
o 10-19 years: 1160 patients
o 20-29 years: 1207 patients
o 30-39 years: 1191 patients
o 40-49 years: 1137 patients
o 50-59 years: 1147 patients
o 60-69 years: 1150 patients
o 70-79 years: 1048 patients
* This data provides insights into which age groups require emergency services the most.
  
# 6. Patient Department Referral by Specialty
* Shows how many patients attended different specialties: 
o None: 5400
o General Practice: 1840
o Orthopaedics: 995
o Physiotherapy: 276
o Cardiology: 248
o Neurology: 193
o Gastroenterology: 178
o Renal: 86
* Helps in identifying the most in-demand specialties in the ER.
  
# Learnings from the Dashboard
This dashboard enables hospitals to:
* Monitor Patient Trends: Identify peak times and patient demographics for better preparedness.
* Improve Resource Allocation: Allocate medical staff and resources based on real-time demand.
* Enhance Patient Experience: Reduce wait times and improve satisfaction scores by addressing delays.
* Optimize Specialty Services: Understand the demand for various medical specialties and optimize service availability.
* Track Admission Rates: Evaluate the efficiency of emergency admissions and improve hospital workflow.

# Dashboard Controls
* Month Selection: Users can filter data by selecting a specific month from the vertical navigation on the left.
* Year Selection: The dashboard allows toggling between years (2023 and 2024) to compare yearly performance.
  
# Conclusion
This dashboard provides a holistic view of the emergency room’s operational metrics, allowing for data-driven decision-making. By tracking patient volume, admission trends, waiting times, and satisfaction scores, healthcare professionals can improve efficiency, allocate resources effectively, and enhance patient care outcomes.
